## Project Overview

This project is a **web-based financial tool** designed to automate and enhance the process of stock market analysis.  
It integrates a **Large Language Model (LLM)** with **real-time financial data** to provide comprehensive and actionable insights.

The core of the application is an **AI agent** built with LangChain. This agent is equipped with a suite of tools to perform a variety of analytical tasks:

- **Fetch Current Stock Prices** – Retrieves the latest market data using the `yFinance` library.
- **Aggregate News Articles** – Gathers relevant news from thousands of global sources via the **News API**.
- **Perform Sentiment Analysis** – Evaluates the sentiment of financial news using a specialized **FinBERT** model to determine if market perception is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Synthesize Data** – Reasons about the collected information to generate a concise and informative recommendation.
- **Simulate Trading** – Connects to the **Alpaca API** to check portfolio positions and execute trades in a paper-trading environment.

The entire application is presented through a **user-friendly Streamlit interface**, making sophisticated financial analysis accessible to everyone.
